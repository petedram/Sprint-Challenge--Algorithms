#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is linear O(n) as the number of cycles increases at the same rate as the input n grows i.e. directly proportional.


b) This is Quadratic O(n^2) as it grows faster as n is increased due to the nested loops. i.e. 2 = 4 cycles, 3 = 9 cycles, 4 = 12 cycles.


c) bunnyEars will run once for each input above 0 therefore this is Linear O(n) as it grows in direct proportion.
